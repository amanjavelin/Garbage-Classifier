# ♻️ Garbage Classification System

A deep learning–based image classification project that categorizes waste into classes such as Cardboard, Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, and Trash using transfer learning with MobileNetV3Large.

The primary focus of this project is building and evaluating an accurate image classification model, along with exploring deployment using Streamlit.
